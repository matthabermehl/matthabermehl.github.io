# Enactive Emergence: Navigating Pockets of Computability in Cognitive Systems

**Abstract**

In contemporary philosophy of cognitive science, understanding how cognitive processes emerge from the complex interplay between an organism and its environment remains a profound challenge. This paper proposes an integrated framework that combines Multi-Scale Information Supervenience (MIS) Theory with enactivism, autopoiesis, Daniel Dennett's concept of "real patterns," and Erik Hoel's notion of effective information. By weaving together these perspectives, we argue that cognitive systems actively engage with "pockets of computability" in their environment—regions where complexity becomes tractable, enabling meaningful interaction and cognition. This enactive approach situates cognition as an emergent property arising from dynamic, multi-scale interactions, aligning with embodied, embedded, and enactive (3E) approaches to cognitive science. Our framework offers a novel perspective on emergence, supervenience, and the extended mind, contributing to ongoing debates in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

## Introduction

The quest to understand how cognitive processes emerge from the intricate dance between organisms and their environments has long captivated philosophers and cognitive scientists alike. Traditional computational models of mind have often fallen short in capturing the richness of embodied experience and the dynamic nature of cognition. As we grapple with the limitations of reductionist approaches, new paradigms are emerging that emphasize the embodied, embedded, and enactive nature of cognitive systems.

In this paper, we embark on a journey to explore how cognitive systems navigate their complex environments by engaging with "pockets of computability"—regions where the overwhelming complexity of the world becomes amenable to interaction and understanding. By integrating the Multi-Scale Information Supervenience (MIS) Theory with enactivism, autopoiesis, Daniel Dennett's concept of "real patterns," and Erik Hoel's notion of effective information, we construct a narrative that situates cognition as an emergent phenomenon rooted in the active engagement of organisms with their environments.

Our journey begins by examining the limitations of traditional cognitive models and the need for a new framework that accounts for the multi-scale nature of information and computation in cognitive systems. We then delve into the enactive and autopoietic perspectives, exploring how organisms co-create their cognitive domains through dynamic interactions. By weaving in Dennett's "real patterns" and Hoel's effective information, we highlight how cognitive systems identify and exploit patterns that facilitate meaningful engagement with the world.

Through this integrated framework, we offer a fresh perspective on emergence and supervenience, proposing that cognition emerges not merely from neural processes within the brain but from the embodied, embedded, and enactive interplay between organisms and their environments. This narrative situates our ideas within the broader discourse of cognitive science and philosophy of mind, offering novel insights and contributing to ongoing debates about the nature of cognition and consciousness.

## The Limitations of Traditional Cognitive Models

For decades, cognitive science has been dominated by computational and representational theories of mind, where cognition is viewed as information processing within the brain. While these models have provided valuable insights, they often struggle to account for the fluidity and context-dependence of cognitive processes observed in real-world settings. The "cognitivist" approach tends to abstract away from the body and environment, treating cognition as a disembodied computational activity.

This reductionist perspective faces significant challenges:

1. **Complexity Overload**: The sheer complexity of environmental interactions makes it infeasible for cognitive systems to compute and represent every detail.
2. **Context Sensitivity**: Cognitive processes are deeply influenced by the context in which they occur, including the physical body and environment.
3. **Embodiment**: The role of the body in shaping perception and action is often overlooked in traditional models.

These limitations have led to the rise of alternative frameworks that emphasize the embodied, embedded, and enactive nature of cognition.

## Enactivism and Autopoiesis: Cognition as Embodied Action

### Enactivism

Enactivism posits that cognition arises through the dynamic interaction between an organism and its environment. Cognition is not merely internal computation but is enacted through bodily engagement with the world. This perspective emphasizes that:

- **Perception and Action Are Intertwined**: Perception is an active process of exploring the environment, and action is informed by perceptual input.
- **Cognition Is Contextual**: Cognitive processes are shaped by the specific environmental and bodily contexts in which they occur.
- **Knowledge Is Embodied**: Understanding arises from the lived experience of interacting with the world.

### Autopoiesis

Autopoiesis, introduced by Maturana and Varela, describes living systems as self-producing and self-maintaining networks of processes. Key aspects include:

- **Self-Organization**: Autopoietic systems continuously regenerate and maintain themselves.
- **Structural Coupling**: The organism and environment co-determine each other's dynamics through recurrent interactions.
- **Operational Closure**: While open to energy and matter exchange, autopoietic systems are organizationally closed, maintaining their identity.

## Navigating Complexity: Pockets of Computability

In a world of immense complexity, how do cognitive systems avoid being overwhelmed? We propose that organisms navigate their environments by seeking out "pockets of computability"—regions where complexity is reduced, and meaningful patterns can be discerned.

### Multi-Scale Information Supervenience (MIS) Theory

MIS Theory provides a framework for understanding how information and computational complexity transform across scales:

- **Scale-Dependent Information**: Information content and computational complexity vary at different scales.
- **Coarse-Graining**: Simplifying complex systems by focusing on higher-level patterns reduces computational demands.
- **Emergence**: New properties and behaviors emerge at higher scales that are not apparent at lower levels.

By applying MIS Theory to cognitive systems, we can understand how organisms engage with their environments at multiple scales, focusing on levels where computation is tractable.

### Dennett's Real Patterns

Daniel Dennett's concept of "real patterns" complements this view:

- **Patterns as Explanatory Constructs**: Real patterns are regularities that allow for compression of information and prediction.
- **Ontological Status**: Patterns are considered real if they provide explanatory power, even if they are abstract.
- **Application to Cognition**: Cognitive systems identify and exploit real patterns in their environments to make sense of the world.

By recognizing and engaging with real patterns, organisms effectively reduce the computational complexity of their environments.

## Effective Information and Causal Emergence

Erik Hoel's notion of effective information provides a quantitative measure of causal influence within a system:

- **Effective Information (EI)**: Quantifies the degree to which a system's state influences its future states.
- **Causal Emergence**: Higher-level structures can exhibit greater EI than their constituent parts, indicating emergent causal power.

In cognitive systems:

- **Higher-Level Cognitive Structures**: Neural assemblies and cognitive processes can have greater EI than individual neurons.
- **Enhancing Computability**: By operating at levels with higher EI, cognitive systems can process information more efficiently.

---

## Enactive Engagement with the Environment

Cognitive systems are not passive recipients of environmental input but actively engage with their surroundings:

- **Sense-Making**: Organisms interpret environmental signals in the context of their own needs and goals.
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Through enactive engagement, organisms adjust their actions to navigate pockets of computability.
- **Co-Creation of Cognitive Domains**: The organism and environment co-create the meaningful structures that facilitate cognition.

This dynamic interaction aligns with the enactivist view that cognition is an ongoing process of embodied action in the world.

## Extended Mind and Cognition

The extended mind thesis, proposed by Clark and Chalmers, argues that cognitive processes can extend beyond the brain into the body and environment:

- **Cognitive Extensions**: Tools, language, and other environmental structures can become part of the cognitive system.
- **Distributed Cognition**: Cognitive processes are distributed across neural, bodily, and environmental components.

Our integrated framework supports this thesis by:

- **Multi-Scale Interactions**: Recognizing that cognition involves interactions at multiple scales, both internal and external.
- **Environmental Computability**: Emphasizing that organisms exploit computable patterns in the environment to extend their cognitive capacities.

---

## Implications for Emergence and Supervenience

### Rethinking Emergence

Traditional notions of emergence often struggle to explain how higher-level phenomena arise from lower-level processes. Our framework offers a new perspective:

- **Emergence Through Interaction**: Cognitive processes emerge from the dynamic interplay between organism and environment.
- **Multi-Scale Causality**: Higher-level patterns exert causal influence, not reducible to lower-level interactions.
- **Enactive Emergence**: Emergence is an active process involving the organism's engagement with the world.

### Supervenience Revisited

Supervenience maintains that higher-level properties depend on lower-level states. Our framework refines this concept:

- **Dependence and Autonomy**: While cognitive processes depend on physical substrates, they exhibit autonomy through emergent patterns and interactions.
- **No Simple Reduction**: The complexity and multi-scale nature of cognitive systems prevent straightforward reduction to neural states.

## Situating the Framework in Current Discourse

Our integrated framework resonates with ongoing debates in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science:

- **Embodied Cognition**: Aligns with perspectives emphasizing the role of the body in shaping cognition.
- **Enactivism**: Supports the view that cognition arises through active engagement with the environment.
- **Complex Systems**: Contributes to the understanding of how complex, adaptive systems give rise to emergent properties.

By bridging MIS Theory with enactivism and related concepts, we offer a cohesive narrative that advances the discourse on cognition and consciousness.


### **Deepening the Integration: MIS Theory's Contribution to Cognitive Science**

To fully appreciate how Multi-Scale Information Supervenience (MIS) Theory advances our understanding of cognition, we must explore its foundational principles in greater depth and examine their interplay with enactivism, autopoiesis, real patterns, and effective information. This exploration reveals how cognitive systems navigate complexity, how emergent properties arise from multi-scale interactions, and how MIS Theory enriches current theoretical frameworks in cognitive science.

### **Navigating Environmental Complexity with MIS Theory**

MIS Theory posits that information and computational complexity are inherently multi-scaled within any system. This recognition has profound implications for cognitive systems operating in complex environments.

**Information Hierarchies and Selective Engagement:**

- **Hierarchical Information Structures:** Systems possess layered information, from granular details to overarching patterns. Cognitive systems can selectively engage with these layers based on relevance and computational feasibility.
- **Scale-Dependent Computability:** Lower-level details often involve immense computational complexity, whereas higher-level patterns can be more tractable. Cognitive systems capitalize on this by focusing on scales where computation is manageable.
- **Coarse-Graining Mechanisms:** Through perceptual and cognitive processes analogous to coarse-graining, organisms abstract essential features from sensory input, filtering out unnecessary complexity.

For example, when navigating a forest, a bird doesn't process every leaf's position but perceives tree branches as navigable structures, effectively operating at a higher informational scale.

### **Enactive Cognition Through MIS Principles**

Enactivism emphasizes cognition as arising from active engagement with the environment. MIS Theory provides a structural explanation for how such engagement is possible amidst environmental complexity.

**Dynamic Scaling and Embodied Interaction:**

- **Adaptive Focus:** Cognitive systems dynamically adjust their focus across scales, honing in on information that is contextually significant.
- **Embodied Computation:** The body's sensory and motor systems serve as interfaces for scaling information processing, embodying computation in physical interaction.
- **Feedback Loops:** Continuous feedback between action and perception allows organisms to refine their engagement with relevant informational scales.

Consider how a pianist adjusts their touch based on auditory feedback, integrating sensory information at multiple scales to produce harmonious music.

### **Autopoietic Systems and Multi-Scale Integration**

Autopoiesis describes systems that self-produce and maintain their organization. MIS Theory illuminates how such systems manage the informational demands of self-organization.

**Hierarchical Self-Maintenance:**

- **Cross-Scale Coordination:** Autopoietic systems coordinate processes across molecular, cellular, and organismal levels, integrating information to sustain life functions.
- **Information Integration:** MIS Theory explains how information from disparate scales is synthesized, enabling coherent functioning despite environmental fluctuations.
- **Resilience Through Coarse-Graining:** By abstracting critical information, autopoietic systems maintain stability without being overwhelmed by lower-level noise.

An organism's immune response exemplifies this, where the system identifies patterns of infection at a macro level without tracking every molecular interaction.

### **Real Patterns as Cognitive Anchors**

Dennett's real patterns are instrumental in understanding how cognitive systems identify and interact with their environments effectively.

**Pattern Recognition and Predictive Capacity:**

- **Exploiting Regularities:** Cognitive systems detect patterns that offer predictive power, allowing for efficient navigation and decision-making.
- **Compression of Information:** By representing environmental features through patterns, organisms reduce computational load, focusing on salient aspects.
- **Action-Oriented Perception:** Recognizing real patterns enables organisms to anticipate outcomes and adjust behaviors proactively.

For instance, predators rely on movement patterns to predict prey behavior, illustrating how pattern recognition aids survival.

### **Effective Information and Emergent Properties**

Hoel's effective information provides insight into how macro-level structures exert causal influence in cognitive systems.

**Macro-Level Causality and Cognitive Function:**

- **Enhanced Causal Power:** MIS Theory explains that as information integrates across scales, higher-level structures gain causal efficacy not apparent at lower levels.
- **Top-Down Influence:** Cognitive processes at the macro scale can shape micro-level activities, such as attention modulating sensory processing.
- **Optimization of Information Flow:** Systems may evolve to maximize effective information, enhancing adaptability and efficiency.

Neural assemblies coordinating complex behaviors demonstrate how macro-level organization governs micro-level neural activity.

### **Extending the Mind Through MIS Theory**

The extended mind thesis posits that cognitive processes can extend into the environment. MIS Theory supports and elaborates on this concept.

**Distributed Cognition Across Scales:**

- **Integration of External Resources:** Tools and technologies become part of the cognitive process when they are seamlessly integrated at the appropriate informational scales.
- **Environmental Embedding:** Cognitive systems leverage environmental structures to offload computation, as seen in using written language to extend memory.
- **Dynamic Coupling:** MIS Theory accounts for how internal and external informational scales interact, creating a cohesive cognitive system that transcends the organism's physical boundaries.

Navigational skills using landmarks exemplify cognition extended into the environment, where external cues are integral to the cognitive process.

### **Advancing Cognitive Science and Philosophy of Mind**

MIS Theory offers significant contributions to ongoing debates in cognitive science and philosophy.

**Challenging Reductionism:**

- **Non-Reductive Emergence:** By demonstrating how higher-level properties emerge from but are not reducible to lower-level processes, MIS Theory provides a robust framework against reductionist accounts.
- **Bidirectional Causality:** Acknowledging top-down and bottom-up interactions across scales enriches our understanding of complex systems.

**Enhancing Theories of Consciousness:**

- **Informational Integration:** MIS Theory aligns with Integrated Information Theory (IIT) by emphasizing the importance of information integration for consciousness.
- **Embodied Consciousness:** By situating cognitive processes within multi-scale interactions, the theory supports views that consciousness is an emergent property of embodied engagement.

**Informing Research and Practice:**

- **Interdisciplinary Applications:** MIS Theory's principles can inform artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and psychology, offering new avenues for exploring cognition.
- **Empirical Testability:** The framework suggests hypotheses about how scaling of information processing affects behavior, which can be empirically investigated.

By delving into MIS Theory's principles and their implications for cognitive systems, we gain a deeper understanding of how organisms navigate complexity, how emergent properties arise, and how cognition extends beyond the confines of the brain. This enriched perspective not only advances theoretical discussions but also has practical implications for research across disciplines.

## Conclusion

Cognitive systems navigate the overwhelming complexity of their environments by engaging with pockets of computability—regions where patterns become discernible and interaction becomes feasible. This enactive process is deeply rooted in the embodied and embedded nature of organisms, highlighting the importance of multi-scale interactions in the emergence of cognition.

Our integrated framework, combining MIS Theory with enactivism, autopoiesis, Dennett's real patterns, and Hoel's effective information, provides a novel perspective on emergence and supervenience. It situates cognition as an emergent property arising from the dynamic interplay between organism and environment, challenging reductionist models and enriching our understanding of the mind.

By constructing this narrative, we contribute to the ongoing discourse in philosophy of cognitive science, offering insights that have implications for theories of extended mind, embodied cognition, and the nature of consciousness itself. Our journey underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in unraveling the complexities of cognition, inviting further exploration and dialogue.
