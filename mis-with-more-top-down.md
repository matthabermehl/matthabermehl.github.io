### **1. Multi-Level Networks**

#### **1.1 Introduction**

**Multi-level networks** (also known as **multi-layer networks** or **interdependent networks**) are mathematical structures that represent systems with multiple types of interactions or multiple layers of connectivity. Each level or layer can represent a different scale or type of interaction, and nodes can exist in multiple layers.

#### **1.2 Mathematical Definition**

- **Network Structure:**

  A multi-level network is defined as a tuple \( G = (V, E, L) \), where:

  - \( V \) is the set of nodes.
  - \( E \) is the set of edges.
  - \( L \) is the set of layers or levels.

- **Nodes and Layers:**

  Each node \( v \in V \) can exist in one or more layers \( l \in L \). The presence of node \( v \) in layer \( l \) is denoted as \( v_l \).

- **Edges:**

  - **Intra-Layer Edges:** Edges between nodes within the same layer \( l \) are denoted \( E_l \).
  - **Inter-Layer Edges:** Edges between nodes in different layers \( l \) and \( m \) are denoted \( E_{l,m} \).

#### **1.3 Mathematical Formulation**

1. **Adjacency Tensors:**

   - **Intra-Layer Adjacency Matrix \( A^l \):**

     \( A^l_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if there is an edge between } v_i \text{ and } v_j \text{ in layer } l \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \)

   - **Inter-Layer Adjacency Tensor \( A^{lm} \):**

     \( A^{lm}_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{if there is an edge between } v_i \text{ in layer } l \text{ and } v_j \text{ in layer } m \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \)

2. **Degree Vectors:**

   - **Intra-Layer Degree \( k^l_i \):**

     \( k^l_i = \sum_{j} A^l_{ij} \)

   - **Inter-Layer Degree \( k^{lm}_i \):**

     \( k^{lm}_i = \sum_{j} A^{lm}_{ij} \)

3. **Dynamics on Multi-Level Networks:**

   The state of node \( v_i \) in layer \( l \) at time \( t \) is denoted as \( x_i^l(t) \).

   - **Intra-Layer Dynamics:**

     \( \frac{dx_i^l}{dt} = F^l(x_i^l, \{ x_j^l \}_{j \in N^l_i}) \)

     where \( N^l_i \) is the set of neighbors of node \( i \) in layer \( l \), and \( F^l \) is the intra-layer interaction function.

   - **Inter-Layer Dynamics:**

     \( \frac{dx_i^l}{dt} = \cdots + \sum_{m \neq l} G^{lm}(x_i^l, x_i^m) \)

     where \( G^{lm} \) represents the influence of node \( i \) in layer \( m \) on node \( i \) in layer \( l \).

#### **1.4 Modeling Inter-Scale Interactions**

- **Layers Represent Scales:**

  Each layer \( l \) represents a different scale \( s \) in the system.

- **Inter-Scale Influence:**

  Inter-layer edges \( E_{l,m} \) model the influence between scales \( s \) and \( s' \).

- **Bidirectional Influence:**

  Inter-layer dynamics \( G^{lm} \) allow for influence in both directions between scales.

#### **1.5 Example Application**

**Ecosystem Modeling:**

- **Layers:**

  - **Species Level (Micro-scale):** Interactions between individual organisms.
  - **Population Level (Meso-scale):** Dynamics of species populations.
  - **Ecosystem Level (Macro-scale):** Overall ecosystem processes.

- **Inter-Layer Edges:**

  - Influence of individual behaviors on population dynamics.
  - Impact of population changes on ecosystem processes.
  - Feedback from ecosystem changes affecting individual behaviors.

### **2. Hierarchical Models with Feedback Loops**

#### **2.1 Introduction**

Hierarchical models with feedback loops represent systems where entities are organized in a hierarchy of levels or scales, and there are interactions both within and between levels, including feedback mechanisms that allow higher levels to influence lower levels (top-down causation) and vice versa (bottom-up causation).

#### **2.2 Mathematical Formulation**

1. **Hierarchical Levels:**

   Define a set of levels \( \{ L_1, L_2, \dots, L_n \} \), where \( L_1 \) represents the lowest scale and \( L_n \) the highest.

2. **State Variables:**

   At each level \( L_k \), define state variables \( X^{(k)} \).

3. **Dynamics with Feedback:**

   The dynamics at each level are given by:

   \( \frac{dX^{(k)}}{dt} = f^{(k)}(X^{(k)}, X^{(k-1)}, X^{(k+1)}) \)

   where:

   - \( f^{(k)} \) is the dynamic function at level \( L_k \).
   - \( X^{(k-1)} \) represents influences from the lower level (bottom-up).
   - \( X^{(k+1)} \) represents influences from the higher level (top-down).

4. **Boundary Conditions:**

   - For the lowest level \( L_1 \):

     \( \frac{dX^{(1)}}{dt} = f^{(1)}(X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}) \)

   - For the highest level \( L_n \):

     \( \frac{dX^{(n)}}{dt} = f^{(n)}(X^{(n)}, X^{(n-1)}) \)

#### **2.3 Modeling Bidirectional Influence**

- **Feedback Loops:**

  Feedback loops are created through the dependence of \( X^{(k)} \) on both \( X^{(k-1)} \) and \( X^{(k+1)} \).

- **Co-Emergence of Scales:**

  The dynamics at each level are intertwined, reflecting the co-emergence and mutual influence of scales.

#### **2.4 Example Application**

**Economic Systems:**

- **Levels:**

  - **Individual Level (L1):** Consumer and firm behaviors.
  - **Market Level (L2):** Market dynamics and prices.
  - **Macroeconomic Level (L3):** National economic indicators.

- **Dynamics:**

  - **L1 Dynamics:**

    \( \frac{dX^{(1)}}{dt} = f^{(1)}(X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}) \)

    Individual decisions are influenced by market conditions.

  - **L2 Dynamics:**

    \( \frac{dX^{(2)}}{dt} = f^{(2)}(X^{(2)}, X^{(1)}, X^{(3)}) \)

    Market dynamics are influenced by individual behaviors and macroeconomic policies.

  - **L3 Dynamics:**

    \( \frac{dX^{(3)}}{dt} = f^{(3)}(X^{(3)}, X^{(2)}) \)

    National economy is influenced by market trends.

### **3. Multi-Scale Dynamical Systems**

#### **3.1 Introduction**

**Multi-scale dynamical systems** involve equations that describe the evolution of variables at different scales, often using differential equations with scale-dependent parameters or variables. These systems can capture the interactions between fast (small scale) and slow (large scale) dynamics.

#### **3.2 Mathematical Formulation**

1. **Separation of Scales:**

   Variables are separated into fast variables \( x \) and slow variables \( y \).

2. **Coupled Differential Equations:**

   \( \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) \)

   \( \frac{dy}{dt} = \epsilon g(x, y) \)

   where \( \epsilon \) is a small parameter indicating the separation of time scales.

3. **Scale Interactions:**

   The fast dynamics \( x \) and slow dynamics \( y \) are coupled, allowing for bidirectional influence.

#### **3.3 Modeling Inter-Scale Dynamics**

- **Fast Variables Influencing Slow Variables:**

  The function \( g(x, y) \) includes dependence on \( x \), allowing fast dynamics to influence slow dynamics (bottom-up influence).

- **Slow Variables Influencing Fast Variables:**

  The function \( f(x, y) \) includes dependence on \( y \), allowing slow dynamics to influence fast dynamics (top-down influence).

#### **3.4 Example Application**

**Climate Modeling:**

- **Fast Variables:**

  Atmospheric variables (e.g., temperature, pressure).

- **Slow Variables:**

  Oceanic variables (e.g., ocean currents, sea temperature).

- **Dynamics:**

  Atmospheric conditions (fast variables) influence ocean currents, while changes in ocean currents (slow variables) affect atmospheric conditions.

### **4. Information-Theoretic Frameworks**

#### **4.1 Introduction**

An information-theoretic approach uses measures like **mutual information**, **entropy**, and **transfer entropy** to quantify the information exchange within and between scales.

#### **4.2 Mathematical Formulation**

1. **Entropy at Each Scale:**

   \( H_s = -\sum_{i} p_s(i) \log p_s(i) \)

   where \( p_s(i) \) is the probability distribution of states at scale \( s \).

2. **Mutual Information Between Scales:**

   \( I(s; s') = H_s + H_{s'} - H_{s, s'} \)

   where \( H_{s, s'} \) is the joint entropy of scales \( s \) and \( s' \).

3. **Transfer Entropy:**

   Measures the directed information transfer from scale \( s \) to scale \( s' \):

   \( T_{s \to s'} = \sum_{i, j} p(i_{t+1}^{s'}, i_t^s) \log \frac{p(i_{t+1}^{s'} | i_t^s)}{p(i_{t+1}^{s'})} \)

#### **4.3 Modeling Bidirectional Information Flow**

- **Inter-Scale Information Dynamics:**

  By calculating \( T_{s \to s'} \) and \( T_{s' \to s} \), we can quantify the information flow in both directions between scales.

- **Feedback and Co-Emergence:**

  High mutual information and transfer entropy indicate strong coupling and co-emergence of scales.

#### **4.4 Example Application**

**Neuroscience:**

- **Scales:**

  - **Neuronal Level (Micro-scale):** Firing of individual neurons.
  - **Network Level (Meso-scale):** Activity patterns of neuronal networks.
  - **Cognitive Level (Macro-scale):** Emergence of cognitive functions.

- **Information Measures:**

  - **Entropy:** Measure the variability at each scale.
  - **Mutual Information:** Quantify the dependency between neuronal activity and network patterns.
  - **Transfer Entropy:** Determine the directionality of information flow between scales.

### **5. Category Theory and Functorial Mappings**

#### **5.1 Introduction**

**Category theory** provides a high-level mathematical language to describe systems in terms of objects and morphisms (arrows) and can model inter-scale interactions through **functors** that map between categories representing different scales.

#### **5.2 Mathematical Formulation**

1. **Categories at Each Scale:**

   Define categories \( \mathcal{C}_s \) for each scale \( s \), where:

   - **Objects:** Represent entities or states at scale \( s \).
   - **Morphisms:** Represent processes or transformations at scale \( s \).

2. **Functors Between Scales:**

   A functor \( F_{s \to s'}: \mathcal{C}_s \to \mathcal{C}_{s'} \) maps objects and morphisms from scale \( s \) to scale \( s' \).

   - **Object Mapping:**

     \( F_{s \to s'}(A) = F(A) \)

   - **Morphism Mapping:**

     \( F_{s \to s'}(f: A \to B) = F(f): F(A) \to F(B) \)

3. **Natural Transformations:**

   Natural transformations can represent inter-scale feedback loops.

   - Given functors \( F, G: \mathcal{C}_s \to \mathcal{C}_{s'} \), a natural transformation \( \eta: F \Rightarrow G \) assigns to each object \( A \) in \( \mathcal{C}_s \) a morphism \( \eta_A: F(A) \to G(A) \).

#### **5.3 Modeling Inter-Scale Interactions**

- **Bidirectional Functors:**

  Functors can map in both directions between scales, representing bidirectional influence.

- **Inter-Scale Relationships:**

  Natural transformations capture the relationships between different ways of mapping scales, allowing for complex interdependencies.

#### **5.4 Example Application**

**Computer Science (Type Theory):**

- **Levels:**

  - **Syntax Level (Micro-scale):** Symbols and grammar rules.
  - **Semantics Level (Macro-scale):** Meaning and interpretation of programs.

- **Functors:**

  - Syntax-to-Semantics Functor \( F \): Maps syntactic constructs to their semantic meanings.
  - Semantics-to-Syntax Functor \( G \): Reflects how semantic requirements influence syntactic structures.

- **Natural Transformations:**

  Capture the consistency conditions between different interpretations or implementations.
