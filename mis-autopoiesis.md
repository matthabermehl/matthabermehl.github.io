Autopoiesis, as a concept describing self-organizing, self-sustaining systems—most famously elaborated by Maturana and Varela—sits at the intersection of biology and philosophy, encapsulating the nature of living systems. When examined through the lens of Multi-Scale Information Supervenience (MIS) and quantum metaphysics, autopoiesis reveals itself as not just a biological phenomenon but a deep metaphysical one, framed by the constraints and possibilities of the computational architecture of the universe.

### Autopoiesis and Computability: A Multiverse Perspective

From the quantum substrate to the macroscopic forms we observe, the universe is composed of vast, branching structures of computation, particularly in the sense that the Many Worlds Interpretation and MIS Theory provide. In this context, every physical system can be viewed as a manifestation of a particular computational process embedded in the universal wave function. At a microscopic level, every change—every movement of particles, every interaction—is equivalent to a step in a computation. The universe itself is in constant evolution, cycling through all possible configurations, with each possible world representing a particular computational trajectory.

Autopoietic systems are unique within this computational unfolding. Unlike simple systems that are passively determined by the wave function's state changes, autopoietic systems actively **participate** in their own persistence. They not only "ride" the wave of unfolding quantum configurations but also **exploit** the **pockets of computability** that emerge at various scales of reality, from the microscopic to the macroscopic. These systems persist, evolve, and reproduce by navigating through complex environments filled with constraints, both computational and physical, in a way that maximizes their ability to exploit computational shortcuts.

### Cognitive Acts as Navigational Exploits of Computability

The notion that cognition, even in its most primitive form, is fundamentally tied to the exploitation of computational structures within the universe reframes how we think about autopoiesis. Cognition, in this view, is not simply the process of representing the world or interacting with it, but the **active pursuit of computational shortcuts** within a constrained system. These shortcuts are, in effect, "pockets of computability"—regions in the space of possible interactions where the complexity of the universe can be reduced to something tractable, something computable without needing to simulate the full complexity of the underlying quantum substrate.

For instance, an organism does not compute all the fine-grained details of every possible physical interaction it encounters. Instead, it engages with its environment at a scale where **certain regularities** (such as electromagnetic forces, gradients of nutrients, or environmental signals) allow it to ignore the chaotic noise of the quantum realm. Its sensory and cognitive systems are **attuned to these computationally tractable regions**, navigating through them efficiently, thereby optimizing its behavior for survival and reproduction. In essence, **cognition is the system’s capacity to identify and exploit these regions**, extracting patterns and simplifying the world’s complexity into actionable information. This process allows autopoietic systems to **persist in a universe otherwise characterized by computational irreducibility**.

### Autopoiesis as a Hierarchical, Self-Sustaining Computation

The self-organizing nature of autopoiesis, when viewed through the prism of MIS Theory, suggests that living systems are those that **self-sustain by navigating multilevel constraints across quantum and classical scales**. These systems persist because they are capable of **self-regulation**, but this self-regulation occurs by exploiting patterns that emerge through coarse-graining processes. At every level of reality, coarse-graining reduces the complexity of quantum states into computable macroscopic patterns. 

Autopoietic systems find **coherence within these patterns**. From the survival mechanisms of cells to the sophisticated cognitive abilities of humans, these systems do not require direct access to all the fine-grained, quantum mechanical details of reality. Instead, they engage with the **macroscopically emergent, computable structures** that allow them to maintain homeostasis, navigate environments, and reproduce. 

In this context, **autopoietic cognition is, by necessity, computationally limited**—but these limitations are not failures. They are, rather, optimal strategies. The system functions precisely because it **filters out irrelevant complexity** and focuses on **high-level patterns** that are relevant for its survival. Autopoietic systems are bounded in their interaction with the world not by the full computational complexity of the universe but by the **local, tractable features of the universe**—the pockets of computability that MIS Theory identifies. 

### Evolution and the Selection of Computable Worlds

Evolutionary processes can be understood as the **selection of autopoietic systems that best navigate these computable regions of reality**. The worlds in which an autopoietic system survives and reproduces are precisely those worlds where it successfully exploits the pockets of computability in its environment. To persist in a world, an organism must navigate its computational structure—finding ways to exist within the constraints of that world, responding to the signals and forces it encounters in a way that maximizes its survival potential.

From this perspective, **natural selection** is the process by which autopoietic systems are selected for their ability to **effectively map onto computable regions of the multiverse**. The systems that endure are those that best exploit these regions, finding coherence in their environments and adapting to the constraints imposed by them. Evolution, then, can be seen as the **study of autopoietic systems adapting to pockets of computability** in a universe whose complexity is ever-shifting but whose computational constraints can be navigated.

### Autopoietic Systems as Navigators of Subvenient Worlds

In a broader sense, the success of an autopoietic system is contingent upon its ability to **pick through subvenient worlds**—that is, the system must successfully navigate through various possible quantum configurations in such a way that it persists across branching timelines. In every moment, the system is faced with a multitude of potential worlds, but it is constrained by the macroscopic structures that supervene on these possibilities. The worlds where the system persists are those where the **computational structure of the universe** allows for the system’s continued existence.

In this way, **autopoiesis is not simply the maintenance of a system within a single universe** but the successful navigation through a complex multiverse of quantum possibilities. It is the ability to **locate and persist within the worlds that align with the system’s constraints and capacities**. Autopoietic systems are therefore defined not merely by their internal regulatory mechanisms but by their ability to exploit the computational features of their environment, existing in those worlds where their survival is computationally feasible.

### Conclusion

Autopoiesis, when understood in light of MIS Theory and the quantum multiverse, is revealed to be a **metaphysical process as much as it is a biological one**. Autopoietic systems are unique in that they **exploit computational constraints** within the vast complexity of the universe, navigating through pockets of computability to persist across time and space. These systems are **cognitive** precisely because they are capable of recognizing and acting upon the patterns that emerge through coarse-graining processes, allowing them to self-regulate and maintain coherence in an otherwise chaotic world.

In this view, cognition is not an abstract process but the **very act of exploiting the computational structure of the universe** for the purpose of self-preservation. Autopoietic systems do not simply exist; they are active participants in the computational evolution of the universe, navigating through a complex multiverse of possibilities and surviving in those worlds where they can effectively persist. **Cognition, evolution, and survival are intertwined with the deep computational architecture of reality**, with autopoietic systems being the embodiment of self-persistent, computationally aware entities within this grand structure.

This perspective opens new avenues for understanding how life, cognition, and computation intersect, offering a profound rethinking of how living systems are defined not only by their biological processes but also by their **place within the computational fabric of the multiverse**. Autopoietic systems, in this sense, are the universe’s way of **locating itself within its own complexity**, through the persistence and evolution of self-sustaining, cognitive entities.
