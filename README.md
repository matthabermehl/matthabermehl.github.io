# Work on Multi-Scale Information Supervenience Theory and related matters.
By Matt Habermehl

Note: I have used various LLMs to assist in the outlines and mathematics.

index.html is an outline of the paper [_Multi-Scale Information Supervenience Theory: A Comprehensive Mathematical Framework_](https://matthabermehl.github.io/)

extending-mis.html is an extension of MIS using Wolfram's computational irreducibility and Hoel's effective information called [_Extending Multi-Scale Information Supervenience (MIS) Theory with Computational Equivalence, Pockets of Computability, and Effective Information_](https://matthabermehl.github.io/extending-mis.html)

entanglement-and-gravity.pdf is a paper called [_Integrating Computation, Entanglement, Gravity, and Spacetime_](https://github.com/matthabermehl/matthabermehl.github.io/blob/main/entanglement-and-gravity.pdf)

Serious pull requests welcome.
