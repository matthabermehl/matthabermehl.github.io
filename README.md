# Work on Multi-Scale Information Supervenience Theory and related matters.
By Matt Habermehl

index.html is an outline of the paper [_Multi-Scale Information Supervenience Theory: A Comprehensive Mathematical Framework_](https://matthabermehl.github.io/)

extending-mis.html is an extension of MIS using Wolfram's computational irreducibility and Hoel's effective information called [_Extending Multi-Scale Information Supervenience (MIS) Theory with Computational Equivalence, Pockets of Computability, and Effective Information_](https://matthabermehl.github.io/extending-mis.html)
